    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>SECTION 7 - PAYMENT</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span>Our charges for monthly plans are </span><span><a href="https://manychat.com/pricing">posted</a></span><span>&nbsp;on
            our website and may be changed from time to time. If any part of a month is included in the Term, then
            payment is due for the full month. Payments are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day
            you made your first monthly payment (the &ldquo;Pay Date&rdquo;). If you go over your sending limit and
            reach another pricing level, then you&rsquo;ll have to pay at the higher level on or before the next pay
            date. If the Term ends before that payment is due, you&rsquo;ll still be required to make one payment at
            the higher level</span>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span>As long as you have signed up into ManyChat PRO subscription, you&rsquo;ll provide us with valid credit
            card information and authorize us to deduct the monthly charges against that credit card. You&rsquo;ll
            replace the information for any credit card that expires with information for a valid one. Anyone using a
            credit card represents and warrants that they are authorized to use that credit card, and that any and all
            charges may be billed to that credit card and won&rsquo;t be rejected. If we&rsquo;re unable to process
            your credit card order, we&rsquo;ll try to contact you by email and suspend your account until your payment
            can be processed.</span>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span>We&rsquo;ll give you a refund for a prepaid month if we stop providing our Services to you for a reason
            that&rsquo;s not laid out in these Terms of</span><span>&nbsp;Use Policy</span><span>. You won&rsquo;t be
            entitled to a refund from us under any other circumstances. We may offer a refund if a Member applies for
            one based on the requirements posted on the Website.</span>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
